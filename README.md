# Colliding Galaxies

A modern JavaScript implementation of a classic screensaver.

Long ago, Uli Siegmund wrote galaxy.c, the Galaxy Collision Screen Saver, on Amiga for EGS in Cluster.

Many people have ported and tweaked the program. I've done an ES 2015 port here, and wrapped the script in some HTML allowing selection of the number of galaxies to collide.
